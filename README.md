Smart Attendance System using Machine Learning

Description
This project is a web-based Smart Attendance System that uses Machine Learning for real-time face recognition. It simplifies attendance tracking by capturing images via a webcam, comparing them with stored images, and marking attendance in an Excel sheet.

The application has the following key features:

Capture New Images: Add new users by capturing their images through the interface.
Real-Time Attendance: Automatically detect faces through the webcam and match them with the stored images in the uploads folder.
Excel Integration: Mark attendance directly in an Excel sheet, enabling easy record keeping.
Features
User-Friendly Web Interface:

Button to capture and store new images in the uploads folder.
